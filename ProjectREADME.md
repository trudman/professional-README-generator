# Professional README Generator

## Description

This project was my Professional README Generator. This project enabled me to use new skills I have learned with Node.js as well as build on previous skills. This was extremely valuable to help me to feel more comfortbale with devloping and creating usable applications. This also familiarized me more with using fs and inquirer with node. This was a challenging project because we were using newly learned skills with node and using the integrated terminal. Overall, I am very satisfied with how the project turned out and excited to further my knowledge. 

# Installation

To install the user must download the code from Github and install NPM on their machine in the project. To install you must open an integrated terminal and enter "npm init -y".  From there they can open an integrated terminal and enter "node ." or "node index.js" to run the application. From there they will be prompted with several questions to generate the README file. 

# Usage
To use this README generator the user must first install NPM. Once the user runs the application using "node ." in an integrated terminal, a series of questions will populate to gather information about the project. The user will input the information into the application and a README.md file will be created for them.
